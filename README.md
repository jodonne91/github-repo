## Application Template - Basic (Stolen from Kyle Hill)

This template intended for quickly generating test-driven assignments for The Iron Yard. But you can just use it for whatever!

Includes:

* Mocha
* Chai
* jQuery
* _underscore

## Instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

The application will be running on http://localhost:3000 and serving static assets out of /public.
